# Respite Pulse Pattern ðŸŒŠ

A calm, tileable SVG pattern animated with CSS â€” feels like energy is gently flowing through the lines.

## How it works
- The SVG acts as a mask for animated gradients.
- A soft radial pulse drifts across the pattern.
- Background color is adjustable via CSS variables.

## Customize
Edit the variables in `styles/main.css`:
```css
--bg: #0e1015;
--line-base: #84e1ff;
--pulse: #ffffff;
--speed: 22s;
